### Debian 13 Trixie and Ubuntu 23.10 Mantic Minotaur - Hyprland install script based from my Fedora-Hyprland [`Link`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Fedora-Hyprland) and Arch-Hyprland-v4 [`Link`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-v4)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-requisites and VERY Important! ###
- Do not run this installer as sudo or as root
- This Installer requires a user with a priviledge to install packages
- Needs a Debian 13 Testing (Trixie) Branch  as it needs a newer wayland packages! I have tried on Stable Debian 12 Bookworm in which, Hyprland wont build
- edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and remove # on lines with deb-src to enable source packaging else will not install properly especially Hyprland
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
- delete # on the lines with 'deb-src' 
- ensure to allow to install non-free drivers especially for users with NVIDIA gpus. You can also install non-free drivers if required. Edit install-scripts/nvidia.sh and change the nvidia stuff's if required

### üîî NOTICE TO UBUNTU USERS ### 
- You can use this installer. However, I have only tested on Ubuntu 23.10. Not sure if it works on older ubuntu as Hyprland needs an updated wayland libraries. For sure wont work in any Ubuntu LTS.

- For Ubuntu with NVIDIA GPU's, make sure to edit the install-scripts/nvidia.sh . Delete all packages in nvidia_pkg except libva-wayland2 and nvidia-vaapi-driver and uncomment/remove # before sudo ubuntu-drivers install. You also need to delete or simply just add # in the lines 43 and 44  echo "## for nvidia... and echo "deb ...........

### ‚ú®  Some notes on this installer
- This script is meant to install in Debian Testing (Trixie). 
- If However, decided to try, recommend to install SDDM. Apart from GDM and SDDM, any other Login Manager may not work nor launch Hyprland. However, hyprland can be launched through tty by type Hyprland
- It should work on latest Ubuntu 23.10

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING! nwg-look takes long time to install. 
- nwg-look is a utility to costumize your GTK theme. It's a LXAppearance like. Its a good tool though but this package is entirely optional

### ‚ú® Costumize the packages 
- inside the install-scripts folder, you can edit 00-hypr-pkgs.sh. Do not edit 00-dependencies.sh unless you know what you are doing
- default GTK theme if agreed to be installed is Tokyo night GTK themes (dark and light) + Tokyo night SE icons

### üîî NOTICE TO NVIDIA OWNERS ### 
- by default it is installing the latest and newest nvidia drivers. If you have an older nvidia-gpu (GTX 800 series and older), check out nvidia-debian website [`LINK`](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers) and edit nvidia.sh in install-scripts folder to install proper gpu driver

### ‚ú® Hyprland Dot Notes
- super h for launching a small help file

- super t for thunar (file manager)

### ‚ùó some known issues

- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 
```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
7. add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config (.config/hypr/configs/ENVariables.conf)  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to
```
