# ‚ô®Ô∏è‚ô®Ô∏è‚ô®Ô∏è ATTENTION ‚ô®Ô∏è‚ô®Ô∏è‚ô®Ô∏è 06 Dec 2023
- Recent hyprland release v0.33.0, needed a newer libdrm and Debian dont have newer libdrm yet on their repo. That is why for now, the hyprland version to be installed with this script is v0.32.3 


## Debian 13 Trixie and SID and Ubuntu 23.10 Mantic Minotaur Hyprland Install Script



### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-requisites and VERY Important! ###
- Do not run this installer as sudo or as root
- This Installer requires a user with a priviledge to install packages
- Needs a Debian 13 Testing (Trixie) Branch  as it needs a newer wayland packages! I have tried on Stable Debian 12 Bookworm in which, Hyprland wont build.
- In theory, it should also work on Debian SID (unstable) but I have not tested yet.
- edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and remove # on lines with deb-src to enable source packaging else will not install properly especially Hyprland
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
- delete # on the lines with 'deb-src' 
- ensure to allow to install non-free drivers especially for users with NVIDIA gpus. You can also install non-free drivers if required. Edit install-scripts/nvidia.sh and change the nvidia stuff's if required
- If you have login Manager already like GDM (gnome login manager), I highly advice not to install SDDM. But if you decide to install SDDM, see here [`Issue 2 - SDDM`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland/issues/2)

### üîî NOTICE TO UBUNTU USERS ### 
- You can use this installer. However, I have only tested on Ubuntu 23.10. Not sure if it works on older ubuntu as Hyprland needs an updated wayland libraries. For sure wont work in any Ubuntu LTS.
- If you are using Gnome already, DO NOT install the SDDM. The GDM works file as well. For some reason, during installation, you will be asked which login manager you wanted to use. But during my test, nothing happened.
- For Ubuntu with NVIDIA GPU's, make sure to edit the install-scripts/nvidia.sh . Delete all packages in nvidia_pkg except libva-wayland2 and nvidia-vaapi-driver and uncomment/remove # before sudo ubuntu-drivers install. You also need to delete or simply just add # in the lines 44 and 45  echo "echo "## for nvidia" | sudo tee -a... and echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian........

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING! If you have GDM already as log-in manager, DO NOT install SDDM
- You will encounter issues. See [`Issue 2 - SDDM`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland/issues/2)

## ü™ßü™ßü™ß ANNOUNCEMENT ü™ßü™ßü™ß
- This Repo does not contain Hyprland Dots or configs! Dotfiles can be checked here [`Hyprland-Dots`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots) . During installation, if you opt to copy installation, it will be downloaded from that centralized repo.

### ‚ú®  Some notes on this installer / Prerequisites
- install a backup tool like `snapper` or `timeshift`. and Backup your system before installing hyprland using this script. This script DOES not include uninstallation of packages as it may break your system due to shared packages / libraries.
- This script is meant to install in Debian Testing (Trixie). 
- If However, decided to try, recommend to install SDDM. Apart from GDM and SDDM, any other Login Manager may not work nor launch Hyprland. However, hyprland can be launched through tty by type Hyprland
- üïØÔ∏è network-manager-gnome (nm-applet) has been removed from the packages to install. This is because it is known to restart the networkmanager causing issues in the installation process. After you boot up, inorder to get the network-manager applet, install network-manager-gnome. `sudo apt install network-manager-gnome` See below if your network or wifi became unmanaged after installation
- If you have nvidia, and wanted to use proprietary drivers, uninstall nouveau first (if installed). This script will be installing proprietary nvidia drivers and will not deal with removal of nouveau.

- default GTK theme if agreed to be installed is Tokyo night GTK themes (dark and light) + Tokyo night SE icons

### üîî NOTICE TO NVIDIA OWNERS ### 
- by default it is installing the latest and newest nvidia drivers. If you have an older nvidia-gpu (GTX 800 series and older), check out nvidia-debian website [`LINK`](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers) and edit nvidia.sh in install-scripts folder to install proper gpu driver

### ü§¨ FAQ
#### Most common question I got is, Hey Ja, Why the heck it is taking long time to install? Other distro like Arch its only a minute or two. Why here takes like forever?!?!?!
- Well, most of the core packages are downloaded and Build and compiled from SOURCE. There are no pre-built binary (yet) for Debian and Ubuntu. Unlike Other distros, they already have prepacked binary that can just download and install.

### üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Got a questions regarding the Hyprland Dots?
- Head over to wiki Link [`WIKI`](üè¥https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki)


### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap:
- [ ] Install zsh and oh-my-zsh without necessary steps above
- [ ] possibly adding gruvbox themes, cursors, icons

### ‚ùó some known issues
- [ ] reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 
```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
-  add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config (.config/hypr/configs/ENVariables.conf)  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to
```
- more info from the hyprland wiki [`Hyprland Wiki Link`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/FAQ/#my-external-monitor-is-blank--doesnt-render--receives-no-signal-laptop)

- [ ] Does not work in Ubuntu 23.04
- [ ] sddm blackscreen when log-out
- [ ] Installing SDDM if or any other Login Manager installed. See [`Issue 2 - SDDM`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Debian-Hyprland/issues/2)
- [ ] network is down or become unmanaged [`This`](https://askubuntu.com/questions/71159/network-manager-says-device-not-managed) might help
